# Progess Bar React Component
 Create a component called ProgressBar which displays a progress bar. The progress bar should have the following styling applied:  // // A width of 100% // // A height of 20px // // A border radius of 5px // // The completed bit should be green // // The remaining bit should be lightgrey // // You add the CSS to the component using Styled Components or using Inline CSS or adding identifiers and using the css file. It's totally up to you  // // The component should accept a percent prop which is used to determine how many percentage of the progress bar to fill with green colour.
